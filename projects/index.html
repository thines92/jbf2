            We have met with town officials, the director of recreation and
            local construction companies. We have decided that the
            foundation's first project is to renovate the basketball courts
            located adjacent to the Marshfield High School. These courts
            are used daily by the local community and after many years of use
            there is significant wear and tear resulting in several severe cracks.
            These cracks are sizable and have become a safety concern. This has forced
            the children's summer program to be relocated.<br><br>
            Several local companies will be donating their equipment and material
            to help make this project happen and with your help we hope to create a
            wonderful, fun, and safe environment for the community to enjoy.<br><br>
            The Jared Barrows Foundation consistently will be giving scholarships out
            annually to graduating seniors off to college, but has a new initiative
            this year which is the basketball court.</p>
