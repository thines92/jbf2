        <p>
          Jared Robert Barrows and twin Jeffrey Paul Barrows were born on July 22, 1983. They grew up in Marshfield and attended Marshfield
          schools, proudly graduating from Marshfield High School in 2002. From the beginning, Jared had an exceptional talent for making
          others laugh. He was caring, loving and had an abundance of friends who he adored, and they adored him back.
          <br><br>
          After high school, Jared and Jeffrey both attended Nichols College in Dudley, MA. In his sophomore year, Jared decided to major in Art
          and Graphic Design. He transferred to Plymouth State University in Plymouth, NH to pursue his dream. Jared was due to graduate in
          May of 2007. Sadly, 3 weeks before graduation, Jared was assaulted on his way back to his dormitory by another student. He
          sustained a brain injury and remained in a coma for 5 days, before passing away on April 20th, 2007.
          <br><br>
          This Foundation was created in Jared's memory. Because of his kindness, generosity and love for Marshfield, I have no doubt in my
          mind that he would have wanted to give back to the Marshfield community where he grew up.
          <br><br>
          Thank You
          <br><br>
          Anna DaVeiga<br>(Jared's Mom)
